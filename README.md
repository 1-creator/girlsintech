Approach used below is as follows âˆ’

    Input the coordinates as x1, x2, y1 and y2
    Apply the formula to compute the difference between two points
    Print the distance

Algorithm

Start
Step 1-> declare function to calculate distance between two point
   void three_dis(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2)
      set float dis = sqrt(pow(x2 - x1, 2) + pow(y2 - y1, 2) * 1.0)
      print dis
step 2-> In main()
   Set float x1 = 4
   Set float y1 = 5
   Set float x2 = 4
   Set float y2 = 10
   Call two_dis(x1, y1, x2, y2)
Stop
